- allow configuration of format of timestamp (currently: "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")
- look at having filters as plugins
- recording of video
- add support for gnome system tray? - almost done
- include options for font, font color, background color, etc in timestame editor?  This might qualify as too much hassle and/or too many prefs...
- add support for control events
