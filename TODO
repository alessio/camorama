- FIX THREADS IN REMOTE CAPTURE!
- allow configuration of format of timestamp (image and filename)
- better documentation - ongoing ;)
- better/more filters  - ongoing...
- look at having filters as plugins
- recording of video
- add support for gnome system tray? - almost done
- put timestamp into its own dialog with an "Edit" menu entry? 
- make the status bar report the time until the next auto-capture
- include options for font, font color, background color, etc in timestame editor?  This might qualify as too much hassle and/or too many prefs...
